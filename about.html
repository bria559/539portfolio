                            Baby tears is often confused as a type of moss! If allowed to 
                            grow freely, it forms the shape similar to a mat!

            <p id='fact'>Baby tears are great for beginner gardeners, but require regular attention to look nice. It thrives in low light
                and can be watered once a week. In warmer climates, this plant is used outside as a filler plant for rock gardens. 
                In colder climates, if planted outside it will die annually during the coldest months.
            </p>
            <p id='fact'>Baby tears is native to the Mediterranean and blooms in late spring to early summer. They have been introduced and cultivated
                around the world as garden and decoration plants. They can reach a size up to
                about 4 inches tall and 36 inches wide. Baby tears prefer high humidity (75% and up) and do well in a bathroom or kitchen.
            </p>
            <p id='fact'>Baby tears' wild growing patterns are perfect to establish a earthy and natural aesthetic in your home. You can hang baby tears on your wall
                and allow them to droop down like vines. Or you can put them on dressers and TV stands to help it stand out. Baby tears look the best in 
                hanging baskets. You can see how freely they grow and expand.
