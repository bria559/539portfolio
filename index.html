                   Plants are beneficial to a healthy and vibrant atmosphere. In today's digital age, it is important
                   to stay connected with nature and take on the responsibility of nourishing our environment. Houseplants can help you 
                   to open up the space in your home and provide a more holistic feeling. They are also great for removing toxins from the air (read the Plants page to find out more)!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Please do not get discouraged if your first plant does not grow well! I've killed a lot of plants but I've also nurtured a lot of plants.
                    As long as you have enough patience and do your best to tend to your plants' needs, that's all you need to suceed! I suggest watching videos on youtube and connecting with your 
                    community garden to get in otuch with plant growers.

                    This site was created by me, Briana Whyte. I started gardening as a child, but picked it back up 
                    during the pandemic. In my garden, I currently have pineapple sage, eggplants, ginger, broccoli, callaloo, tomatoes, and thai hot peppers.
                    In my bedroom, I have a variety of succulents on my windowsill. Gardening is very therapuetic and it is amazing to watch something you've cared for grow.
