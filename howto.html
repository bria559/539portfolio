        <h1>Tips on how to keep your plants healthy</h1>
        <div class="parallax"></div>
        <div style="height:100px;background-color:beige;font-size:24px">
            View these tips and the form below! 
        </div>
        <div class="howtocont">
            <div class="grid-item">Always check your plants for <b>diseases and pests</b> before purchasing them. If there are diseases or pests, 
            keep these plants isolated from other healthy plants so the healthy plants are not infected as well. You can also use an organic pesticide that is 
            safe for humans and animals. Sometimes, I make my own pest deterrent with a mix of lemon juice and water or apple cider vinegar and water.</div> 
            <div class="grid-item"> If you want to plant <b>seeds</b> for your houseplants, buy organic seeds from
                a local business. You can also propogate plants yourself. In addittion, choose the best potting soil for your plants. Usually, 
                regular potting soil will suffice, and you can add your own organic compounds from your kitchen to make it even better. I typically add organic egg shells,
                old lettuce, or carrot peels.
            </div>
            <div class="grid-item"> To keep your plants growing, you can <b>repot</b> them every 6 months to a year.  You can tell a plant needs to
            be repotted when the roots are escaping the holes in the bottom of the pot, the leaves are yellowing, and fast flowing water through the soil.
            Keeping large plants in small pots will stunt its growth and harm the roots. When you move the plant to a new pot, add more potting soil and do not unravel the plant roots,
        as unraveling it will put the plant into shock and cause it to die.</div>
            <div class="grid-item">Each plant requires a different amount of sunlight and <b>water</b>. Some plants, like baby tears, require 
                water once a week and low light. Other plants require water more frequently or more sunlight. Research to learn your 
                plants' specific needs so they can thrive! During the winter, some sun-loving plants may need to be moved to a winodw or use an
                artificial light. Keep in mind, light and heat are not necessarily the same thing. So keep your plants away from heaters, radiators, or fireplaces
                because it can cause wilting and dehydration.
